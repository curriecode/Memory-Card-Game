## Instructions

This is a classic game of concentration. 

- Start by simply clicking on a card to  flip it over and reveale a symbol then click another to try to find a match. 

- If the cards don't match try again to reveale 2 of the same symbols to get a match. 

 - Once all cards are matched you win the game.

 - Press the restart button or "play again" to shuffle the cards and start a new game.

The timer starts when the first card is clicked and ends when the last cards are matched , you will gain or lose stars depending on your performance and 1 move is added to the counter for each wrong match.

Compete against yourself to beat your best time and score. Have fun!
